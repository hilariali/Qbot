# Responsive Design and Sidebar Navigation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Responsive Design Issues
- **Problem**: Layout was not properly optimized for smaller screen sizes
- **Solution**: Enhanced CSS media queries with comprehensive breakpoints:
  - `@media (max-width: 768px)` - Tablet and mobile devices
  - `@media (max-width: 480px)` - Small mobile devices  
  - `@media (max-width: 360px)` - Extra small screens

### 2. Sidebar Navigation Not Working
